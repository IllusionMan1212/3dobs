3dobs TODOs:
 - [x] Help menu
     - [x] About window
 - [ ] File logger
 - [x] Move console to be under objects
 - [x] Don't have the viewport window be scrollable
 - [x] Object rotation with left click + mouse movement (very rudimentary implementation, but works)
 - [x] Camera movement with shift + left click + mouse movement
 - [x] Ability to change active model
 - [x] Hide inactive models
 - [x] Scroll zoom
 - [x] (BUG) Fix some meshes not rotating around their origin point (in actuality, they don't have an origin point and are only rotating around 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
     - First thing that comes to mind is just rotating them around the center_point of the mesh (which is the bounding box's center point)
 - [x] Default material
