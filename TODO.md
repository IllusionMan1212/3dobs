3dobs TODOs:
 - [x] Help menu
     - [x] About window
 - [x] File logger
 - [x] Logger should log to file, console and stdout
 - [x] Move console to be under objects
 - [x] Don't have the viewport window be scrollable
 - [x] Object rotation with left click + mouse movement (very rudimentary implementation, but works)
 - [x] Camera movement with shift + left click + mouse movement
 - [x] Ability to change active model
 - [x] Hide inactive models
 - [x] Scroll zoom
 - [x] (BUG) Fix some meshes not rotating around their origin point (in actuality, they don't have an origin point and are only rotating around 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
     - First thing that comes to mind is just rotating them around the center_point of the mesh (which is the bounding box's center point)
 - [x] Default material
 - [x] Toggle box for different zooms
 - [x] Increase max zoom-out
 - [x] Slider for model rotation speed
 - [x] Smaller console area
 - [ ] Better object rotation
 - [ ] Ability to change rotation pivot point (needs raycasting and shit)
 - [x] There might be memory leaks somewhere (tracked it down to russimp, will have to write my own .obj and .stl readers)
 - [x] Reset object rotation when changing active model
 - [x] Drag'n'Drop models
 - [x] Config for consistent settings between restarts (home dir preferred)
 - [x] (BUG) when removing a model that's not selected and the selected model is not the last, we select the last one
     - only select the last one if we removed the selected model
 - [x] Use filename for the root node
 - [x] Ship shaders directly in the executable
 - [x] Have the program accept model files as CLI args
 - [x] Have it so that when an instance of 3dobs is open, any other file associated with 3dobs is opened in the same instance
 - [x] Toggle for dis/allowing the one instance option
 - [x] Show how much memory each loaded model is using
 - [ ] Move the invisible point lights to be around selected object from all sides so it's nicely illuminated
 - [x] Shortcuts/keybinds window under the 'Help' menu item
 - [x] Texture support (basic, but it's there)

 - [ ] Bring back the regular camera movement (can maybe be a switch between them) (for later)
